            "statement": "I am interested in the intersection between biology, cognition, and machine learning. My research topics have ranged from purely computational, such as generative modeling and machine perception, to purely biological, such as field ethology with chimpanzees and multiunit extracellular neurophysiology with songbirds, however my primary interest sits somewhere in between, studying computational neuroscience and biologically/cognitively motivated machine learning algorithms."
